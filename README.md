# Nordvpn Status Gnome Extension

Custom gnome extension to display nordvpn connection status, and probably provide all CLI features as well (future implementation)

This is my first gnome extension and will basically be how i'm learning to make gnome extensions, so let me know what you think I should change and why if there is a better way of doing something.

## Instalation

Will be added later as releases where you can download and then extract into your `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` folder.

## Requirements

* nordvpn-bin package
* gnome shell 40 (because that is the version I have).

## Working Currently

* display connection status as well as country and server
