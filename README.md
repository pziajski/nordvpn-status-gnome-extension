# Nordvpn Status Gnome Extension

Custom gnome extension to display nordvpn connection status, details, and overall control.

This is my first gnome extension is will be a learning template, so let me know what you think I should change and why if there is a better way of doing something.

## Instalation

Will be added later as releases where you can download and then extract into your `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` folder.

## Requirements

* nordvpn-bin package
* gnome shell 40 (because that is the version I have).
